    <h1>Manifesto</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p> My goal is to find one thing that explains everything. I think many scientists and physicists have that goal. 
        Even historical ones, the only difference is I am an atheist. I've heard before that the motivation behind 
        Euclid and Newton's body of work was to accurately describe the rules of God, or to quantify reality into 
        a set of equations that explain everything. I want to do the same maybe I am chasing something here that doesn't exist. 
        But I haven't had any other goal before, other then rotting away absorbing meaningless information trying not to think. For me 
        it was the only thing that existed. All I did all the time was ask why why why and so many people didn't understand and did not know how 
        to answer me. I didn't know what I was asking at the time either.</p>

    <p>I have all these ideas about defining life, intelligence, consciousness, our interactions with physics but I have not yet validated my 
        theories with "science" yet. But I get lost in the sauce. Ideas come up and they leave and there isn't really a record of it. So I 
        started writing stuff down but then I all the ideas are mixed up and then I am repeating ideas. So, I needed something like this,
        longer writing where I could map it all out. How all my motivations, projects, learning are all linked to this idea of finding a "truth" 
        or a unifying theory of everything. Overall what I will describe to you might just be a common idea but then why, I ask, is it eating my life.</p>

    <h2>Overall idea</h2>
    <p>The overall idea is that at the root of it all, everything could be summarized to "this" or "that" in other 
        words "1" or "0" and all of our motivations as humans, or the reason why me work, or make companies, or 
        the way we conduct every single thing we do, I believe, is to group things into those categories, "this" or 
        "that". The definition of a company is to group a set of tasks that are similar and doing them all at once. 
        Logistic companies, delivery companies, Information companies etc. I think making categories and identifying categories is the basis of intelligence.
        But the thing we do not know yet is how a system can identify a category organically (without looking for certain rules or telling the system to look for
        certain rules). Finding those patterns is the first step, then its executing a plan to make one tool to do those similar tasks or 
        identify those similar objects.
    </p>

        <p>I believe this is the basis of knowledge and intelligence (and I even want to say consciousness) And what is this fueled by? 
            Well that's energy. Can I prove that simply grouping together similar tasks uses energy to reduces entropy? I don't know. I want to prove it 
            mathematically maybe? But intuitively it makes sense.  Another question: Who cares? I don't know exactly who will benefit from this,
             but this idea helps me make good systems and will hopefully lead me to understand more why its like this. Its the center of the idea of 
             automation, and even building algorithms. if you can group a set of tasks into a bunch of yes or no questions, in other words categorizing
              them like this, you can build the algorithm.

        </p>

    <div class="sidebar">
        <p>(side note: I woke up the next day and was confused I forgot again why this was so interesting to me. But then I remembered and now 
            I need to write it down because I will forget. So I am reading Claude Shannon's masters thesis right now where he summarizes circuits 
            into ones and zeros, a revolutionary idea that basically backs every modern day electrical system. So now we are at the stage where we 
            "can" group things into ones and zeros, but I really want to find a systems that "can" group things into two groups without that being 
            programmed into it. For example with machine learning or even like circuits we have an output that we want. We are designing the program 
            in a way to let us choose what we want as an output and then letting it do that. Even with RNN which I don't have much info on, require some 
            sort of reward function that you are tying to optimize. But maybe we have to design a system to recognize by itself the creation of group. 
            These group could be arbitrary and obviously, by evolution the best systems survive. so like how does a system with no programing of what it 
            should look for, no programmable intelligence create its own intelligence. That's the idea. Its like one step above of Shannon's idea of the 
            symbolical analysis of circuits. It's like a symbolic analysis of the symbolic analysis. So to get to this spot to get to this area which is
             one level deeper, i want to study how wee create systems. how systems are designed naturally and artificially. how are we designing systems,
              how are we identifying these areas of compression or similarity, ( as when tasks are similar we create tools to do them). that is the idea. 
              I need to research these systems deeply. I also started to think about how the energy is utilized in a system. If I give a system a lot of 
              energy, will it start group tasks organically, how does that work. is it just humans that have the machinery to do this? or is this also a 
              symptom of evolution?)</p>

        <p>(side note: imagine we have put an energy varibable that some how in an algorithm, such that the algorithm will always choose the path of least
             resistance)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Another thing which I notice which i think is super important but I have no proof for is that we can only make things within a certain realm of things
         that actually fall within our means. What does "fall within our means" mean? Well its the conceptual version of you can only make mechanical things 
         that fall within the laws of physics. Similarly we can only process information or create information or create conceptual intelligence through 
         conceptual frameworks that already exist. One of them being, the way we convert things into categories, that was already done early in our evolution 
         with genes. Or maybe even earlier, but I don't know about it.</p>

    <h2>Why I am doing the things I am doing?</h2>
    <p>I want to give here a summary of my studies and motivations. And what I want to gain from the other side. The reason I need to do this is for me to
         remember why I want to do the things I do.</p>

    <h3>1. Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>In a ways my job really sparked this idea. I began building tools to manage the tools we 
        already built. The thing that really sparked my theory is how I started building systems to group 
        similar tasks together to create a workflow. I was able to do my work really effciently as a result. Also I do this to pay the bills. </p>

    <h3>2. Neuroscience</h3>
    <p>My undergraduate degree was in Neuroscience. I realized that I was not good at memorizing facts, math and statistics was more my speed. 
        But overall my goals is really to figure out how the brain works. I like large systems and not so much the small stuff.
        The more we look at the smaller stuff the more lost I get. I also feel like we are looking at it from the bottom up instead of the top down.
         We need to look at what these systems do as a whole and then we can figure out the small stuff. Anyways I'm making computational models of 
         neuroscience concepts to understand it better.</p>

    <!-- <p>I'm also going a lab to get research experience but wet lab stuff isn't what I want to do. I don't care about how.</p> -->

    <h3>3. Computer Science</h3>
    <p>a. learning about computation. Algorithms and data structures, and then things like the Kolmogorov complexity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I want to connect this idea to combinatorics. maybe that well help me understand how we group things together</li>
        <li>Mastermind and Wordle</li>
        <li>looking at spaces of possibilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>b. learning about high level programming stuff, to get paid</p>
    <p>c. learning about how computers were made because of that second idea. if i learn how we made something like a computer maybe we can learn
         more about how human intelligence was made and look at what's the next step to computers. I am doing this by doing that NAND to TETRIS course.</p>
    <p>d. reading Shannons masters thesis and then his communication theory paper. I also want to read Alan turnings book/paper</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>maybe differentiations is just spatial differentiations. like when i think about determining this vs that from random data it might be because 
        one area is illuminated and one isn't, creating a bigger 1 and 0.</p>
