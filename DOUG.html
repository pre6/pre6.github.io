        <h1>surfaces and essences: a reflection, a thought process</h1>

        <h2>INTRO</h2>
        <p>I’m reading this book by Douglas Hofstadter, because I watched his talk about 
            categories and analogies and it was exactly what I thought about when I think about 
            what intelligence is. So I’m going to be reading this book and as a continuation 
            of the practice I said I would do. I am writing down my thoughts as I 
            read this book, because frankly I have no idea what to do with the copious 
            amounts of thoughts and feelings I have about this topic.</p>

        <h2>WORDS OF THANKS</h2>

        <p>As I’m reading this, I’m almost jealous that there are people who have similar ideas 
            like this. I really just want to talk to them and have a dialogue about it. My rambling
             are usually not reciprocated and  have no business being the way that they are. </p>

        <h2>PROLOGUE- Analogy as  the core of cognition</h2>


        <h3>Giving Analogy its Due         </h3>

        <blockquote>“for without concepts there can be no thought, and without analogies there can be no
            concepts. This is the thesis that we will develop and support throughout the book.”</blockquote>


        <p>Analogies lead to concepts which lead to thoughts.
        </p>
        <blockquote>“our concepts are selectively triggered by analogies that our brain makes without letup, 
            in an effort to make sense of the new and unknown in terms of the old and known.”</blockquote>

        <p>Currently, I am thinking a lot about neural networks, our brains and how these ideas
            translate to a physical network. My idea of intellegence is that our brain some how is incentivized
            to make binary classifications or "categories" or "concepts" of the world. I belive these 
            classifications arrive becuase similar neurons are fired together in the same patter over time
            which leads them to some how "made more effcient" ( as of now I'm still unsure how that happens)
            . This is what i think is the conceptual equivalence of analogies in the brain and when we 
            repeat or practice these analogies over time, they are compressed and these analogies become concepts.
            What I am saying here is that there is a physical equivalnce of this compression.
            <br>
            <br>

            I might have a naive sense of what exactly a compression looks like in neurla network but
            I imgine it has to do with using less neurons physically. This is an idea I want to explore later on
            in depth. 
        </p>


        <h3>What Dictionaries Don’t Say about Concepts  </h3>

        <p>I used to think a lot about the definition of the word "table".
            It was like the thing I used to talk to people about to try to 
            explain something that I couldn't articulate. I used to ask is a picture of 
            a table a table? what about something that's functionally a table but doesn't look
            like a table? Why do we call certain things a table and other things a chair even 
            when I could possible sit on a table. I used this as an example of absurdity.
            When I was in highschool, I was obsessed with absurdity. Addicted to it even. 
            I would do anything tobe in a situation to witness absurdity. And it was 
            obviously a symptom of my childhood, but I would have never guessed that this sense of aubsurdity
            and asking these questions would help me ask deeper questions about consciousness
            and intellegence, and even might help me come up with answers. These are things I think 
            about when I read this paragraph on the definition of "band".
        </p>
        <p>As I am reading about the concept of "chair" it makes me think about my hypothesis
            of "smaller than the sum of its parts". For example maybe its cheaper to remember the
            "chair" as a concept then what it actually is physically.
