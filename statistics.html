        <h1>statistics is everything</h1>

        <h2>1. introduction</h2>
        <p>When I was a kid, I was blinded into questioning everything. The more I ask this question the more evidence I see that everything 
            is just statistics. Or at least that everything can be explained by statistics. And to add on to that nothing is definite. Everything, our motality, 
            social norms, everything. 
        </p>

        <p>For the longest time (especially through university) the idea that our deepest compulsions and feelings was just a result of evolution
            loathed me. It felt like it was more than just that. In a sense, I have fighting this notion that everything is way it is because of statistics. 
            there was a deeper truth to the world or something. But now, for whatever reason this idea no longer loathed me. Its actually a more powerful thing than
            I realized. The question I have been asking went from "Why do people do things" to "people must do things as a concequence of the way they are built, so what do I want to do?"


        </p>

        <h2>2. why do people do the things they do </h2>

        <p>For the longest time I could never understand why. Why did people do h ethings that they did. There were people around me that were super intense.
            Things had to be a certain way or it was wrong. I understood them on a surface level, but I never understood why. A simple common example of this 
            this folding clothes. Why should we fold our clothes if we wear them later anyway. Why do anything for that matter. 
        </p>
   
        <p>One day I stopped doing it. Andt here were some key things I noticed.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>If I stopped these seemingly useless tasks, things because tangled and disordered. Making things more ordered took a longer time.
                So some of our action are to make the world a more ordered place. 
            </li>
            <li>If I did the repetitive task for a number of repitions it becoame easier over time.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>I discovered that why we do what we do is to make things more ordered. For example, cleaning. Even the purpose of all jobs is to 
            make things more ordered. Teachers, you're ordering a classroom and teaching everyone one thing. The reason why we make companies is to provide one 
            service to a lot of peoeple. That makes things more ordered. Even complex things like language tend to make things, concepts more ordered. But the question still stands,
            Why order things?</p>

            <p>I think the answer is survival. Orderliness increases our chances of survival. An example of this is cleaning. Cleaning decreases the amount of 
                bacteria in your house which effectively decreases the chances of a bacterial infection. This increses your chances of survival. We also build
                tools that order things. Something as simple as a broom, that helps sweep to big tech companies that help organize HR data. 
            </p>
